										<h3>Author</h3>
										<p>Adrian Goldsworthy was born in 1969. He was educated up to the age of sixteen at Westbourne House Preparatory School and Westbourne Boys College in Penarth, South Wales. He attended the Sixth Form at Stanwell Comprehensive School for his A-Levels. From there he went to St John's College, Oxford University and took a First in Ancient and Modern History. Remaining at St John's, he was awarded a D.Phil. in Literae Humaniores (Ancient History) in 1994. The topic of his thesis was 'The Roman Army as a fighting force, 100 BC-AD 200'. A modified version of this was subsequently published in the Oxford Monographs series under the title of The Roman Army at War, 100 BC - AD 200 (1996). This remains in print and is one of the best selling works in the series.</p>
										<p>He was a Junior Research Fellow at Cardiff University for two years and subsequently taught part-time at King's College London and was an assistant professor on the University of Notre Dame's London programme for six years. He also did bits and pieces of teaching at other universities. He has lectured on a range of topics, including both Greek and (particularly) Roman History, but also taught a course on the military history of the Second World War at Notre Dame.</p>
										<p>Teaching is tremendous fun, but writing is even more enjoyable and in the last few years he has given up teaching to write full time. Best of all this avoids the vast weight of administrative work now inevitable in any university post. It is still nice to give lectures and attend conferences, but only when time permits.</p>
										<p>Just in case anybody is interested, he enjoys watching cricket (supporting Glamorgan in the first class game and England internationally), walking, and playing tennis - not terribly well, but with plenty of enthusiasm. He has recently started learning to ride and now wishes he had taken it up long ago.</p>
										<p>Adrian Goldsworthy lives in South Wales.</p>

									<h3>Historical Fiction</h3>
									<p>Apart from his non fiction books on the ancient world, and especially the history of Rome's Republic and Empire, Adrian Goldsworthy also writes historical fiction. At present there are two series of novels. The first, which began with True Soldier Gentlemen, is set in the Peninsular War and follows a group of characters in the fictional 106th Regiment of Foot. So far there are six stories in the series, and the plan is to write another half dozen or so, eventually taking the story on to Waterloo.</p>
									<p>

										Vindolanda is the start of a new series of stories set at the end of the first century and beginning of the second century AD on the northern frontier in Roman Britain. These stories will follow the adventures of Flavius Ferox, centurio regionarius, a Briton serving as a Roman army officer.</p>
